# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using clinical and diagnostic data.
The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to healthcare data and understand how different features
contribute to disease prediction.


## Dataset
- Source: Public heart disease dataset (Kaggle)
- Number of records: ~300 patients
- Number of features: 13 input features + 1 target variable

Each record represents one patient with medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol,
and exercise-induced conditions.


## Problem Type
- Binary Classification
- Target Variable: `target`
  - 1 → Heart disease present
  - 0 → No heart disease


## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Understanding medical features  
3. Data visualization  
4. Preparation for machine learning models  


## Results
Initial data exploration shows a balanced distribution between patients with and without heart disease.
This dataset is suitable for applying classical machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression
and Decision Trees.


## Future Work
- Apply machine learning models for prediction
- Compare performance of different classifiers
- Improve evaluation using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
